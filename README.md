# WeatherPy-Latitude-Analysis
Creation of an automated script that randomly selects 500+ cities around the world and pulls weather data from OpenWeatherMap API outputting scatter plot comparisons of different weather metrics


As a general trend the hottest temperatures occurred near the equator. Interestingly, the hottest temperatures grouped around latitudes (+20 degrees) slightly north of the equator.



The highest humidity on average was at the equator. The scatter plot data showed a reduction in the variance of percent humidity centered at the equator within a range of +20 and -20 degrees latitude.



There was not a strong connection between city latitude and wind speed. The scatter plot data showed a modest reduction in the variance of wind speed centered at the equator. Some of the windiest cities occurred in latitudes farthest from the equator.



There was no correlation between city latitude and the cloudiness of a city. Interestingly, the likelihood of an equatorial city cloudiness (%) near zero was very low.



In summary, these data suggest that on average the closer a city is to the equator the higher the temperature and more humid the city is likely to be. Additionally, there may be a weak association between lower wind speeds or low cloud cover and proximity to the equator.
